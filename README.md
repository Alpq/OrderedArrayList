# OrderedArrayList

My group focused on the implementation of the add and set functions and how the
parent class methods would be called. We agreed that all classes would end up
calling the add function of a parent class (with the NoNullArrayList calling the
ArrayList add method and the OrderedArrayList calling the NoNullArrayList) and
we discussed the syntax of calling a parent method (using super).

As we got to work my group worked on getting the empty NoNullArrayList class to compile,
several classmates received an error involving serialization. We figured this was due
to noncode related differences, since we all executed the same program but not all of us
 were able to compile due to the error.
